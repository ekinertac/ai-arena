# AI Arena - Todo List

## Project Overview

A platform where two AI models have turn-based discussions about user-provided prompts, with real-time user intervention capabilities, whisper functionality, and multi-provider support. The AIs engage in a structured debate format where River defends the user's idea and Sage critiques it.
